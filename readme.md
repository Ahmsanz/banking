# Description

This is a small application that simulates some banking features, such as creating users, accounts, transactions between accounts...

It implements some simple securization measures like authenticating users via json web tokens.

## Routes
- users
    - POST (body: firstName, lastName, age)
    - POST /login
    - GET - get all users
    - PUT/:_id (body: name)
    - DELETE/:_id - deletes user
- accounts
    - POST (body: user _id) - creates new user
    - GET - get user's accounts
    - PUT/:_id (body: funds)
    - DELETE/:_id - deletes account
- transactions
    - POST (body: sender bank account _id, receiver bank account _id, amount) - creates new transaction
    - GET - get user's transactions
    - GET /bank
    - DELETE - deletes transaction
